## Database: 
Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations

## Information: 
Data on women who have reported being victims of violence between 2020-2023

## Interest: 
I would like to be able to analyze the increase in complaints from women victims of violence to compare not only at the local but also the regional level of how the country is in relation to this situation.
